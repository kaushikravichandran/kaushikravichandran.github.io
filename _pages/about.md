Hi! I am a Master's in Computer Science student studying at Georgia Tech. I target specializing in Computer Systems. I will be contributing to the <a href="https://evagatech.readthedocs.io/">EVA</a> project with mentorship from <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/">Prof. Joy Arulraj</a>.

<span style="color:Red;display:inline;">I am on the job market now!</span> I am looking for Applied Scientist/Research SDE/Research Engineering internships as well as full-time opportunities. I wish to use my experience in building robust large-scale systems for querying big data workloads in the form of text, videos and graphs and my skills in producitizing high-quality research to contribute to the very-large databases community as well as drive the product to its north star. Please reach out to me if your team or organization has any openings.
