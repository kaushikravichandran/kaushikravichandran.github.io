Hi! I am a Master's in Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. I target specializing in Computer Systems and am a part of GaTech's <a href="https://db.cc.gatech.edu/">Databases Research Group</a>. I will be contributing to the <a href="https://evagatech.readthedocs.io/">EVA</a> project with mentorship from <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/">Dr Joy Arulraj</a>.

I am looking for Applied Scientist/Research SDE/Research Engineering internships (Summer 2023) and full-time opportunities (December 2023). I wish to use my experience in building robust large-scale systems for big-data analytics and my skills in producitizing high-quality research, to contribute to the very-large databases community as well as drive products to their north star. Please reach out to me if your team or organization has any openings.
