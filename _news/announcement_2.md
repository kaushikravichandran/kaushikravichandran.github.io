I just completed interning at <a href="https://airmettle.com/"> AirMettle </a>, where I worked on interesting state-of-the-art optimizations for tensor data provided by NSF and NOAA. I will be a Teaching Assistant for the <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/courses/4420-f23/"> Database Systems Implementation </a> course, taught by <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/"> Dr Joy Arulraj </a>
