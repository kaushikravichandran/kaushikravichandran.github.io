      description:
        - Worked on optimizing graph algorithms using SIMD acceleration in the <a href="http://www.spiral.net/">SPIRAL</a> group.
        - Designed a set operation based implementation using Intel Vector Instructions of the breadth first search algorithm which beat the benchmark for the breadth first search on some graphs from <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">SNAP</a>.
        - Identified the bottleneck of the algorithm to be the SIMD implementation of small-large set operations
